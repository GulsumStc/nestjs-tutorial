# NestJS - Learning Journey

This repository contains various  crash courses  that I have gathered while learning NestJS, with a focus on TypeORM, JWT, and other NestJS modules.

## Directory Structure

Each course and tutorial is organized into its own folder. Here is the directory structure:

## Key Topics

### TypeORM
TypeORM is an ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript (ES7, ES6, ES5). It allows you to manage your database using object-oriented programming. In NestJS, TypeORM integrates seamlessly and provides powerful features for database management.

Key Concepts:
- Entities and Repositories
- Migrations
- Relationships (One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-Many)

### JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. In NestJS, JWT is commonly used for authentication and authorization.

Key Concepts:
- Creating and Signing Tokens
- Verifying Tokens
- Protecting Routes

### Other NestJS Modules
NestJS provides a wide range of modules to enhance your application development. Here are a few modules I have explored:
- **Config Module**: For managing application configuration.
- **Validation Module**: For validating incoming requests.
- **PostgreSQL**: For managing relational databases using the TypeORM module.
- **REST API**: For creating RESTful endpoints to handle various HTTP requests.
